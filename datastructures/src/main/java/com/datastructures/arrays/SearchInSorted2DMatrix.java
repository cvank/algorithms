 * In a 2-D matrix, every row is increasingly sorted from left to right, and the last number in each row is not greater than the first number of the next row.
 * A sample matrix follows. Please implement a function to check whether a number is in such a matrix or not.
 * It returns true if it tries to find the number 7 in the sample matrix, but it returns false if it tries to find the number 12.
